To check folder which has spaces in its name, don't forget to surround it with double quotes like

`some_path/"folder with space"/somefile.txt`

P.S. You can also try to use '.' as current path but it is out of task scope and should not affect points for the task. 
Added it just for more comfortable testing so if somewhere it will not work just try to run the command in generic way
